# -Basic-Network-Sniffer--BY-EJ
This Python script uses Scapy to sniff network traffic and display packet details. It identifies IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP layers, showing source/destination addresses, ports, protocol info, and TCP flags. If raw data exists, it previews the payload. The sniffer runs continuously, printing structured insights for each captured packet.
